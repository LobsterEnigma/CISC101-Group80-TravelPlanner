## Summary

Change Log (2025-11-12): – Clarified that modularity improves maintainability and debugging.


This version simplifies the Travel Planner into four easy modules with clear conditionals.
This modular structure makes it easier to test, debug, and update each component independently.
It ensures plans are practical, adaptive, and human-like while keeping structure invisible.

## 100 Reflection Word Reflect 
The system prompt establishes the rules, tone, and structure that the travel planner must follow, ensuring the AI follows the same requests across all modules. The reference file is the project's guideline, which means it becomes the guide for understanding and explaining each module, so we were able to update parts without breaking others. GitHub is essential because it allows us to work together much more smoothly and coordinate changes and the organization of writing. The features GitHub provides allow us to create commits and branches, and to check the version history, helping maintain changes, support modular development, and debug. Overall, these tools have taught us to work together to create clarity while developing and maintaining our group work.
